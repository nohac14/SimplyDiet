SimplyDiet is an iOS application meant to run on an iPhone. The app's main function is to track your food, calories, and exercise. You simply input the food and the amount of calories it has (and exercise) and a calorie counter will be updated on the main Home tab. There is a Profile tab where the user can save their personal information (height, weight, etc.) and offers body mass index (BMI) calculator functionality. The Settings tab offers the option to opt in for notifications that remind the user to add their calories after each meal of the day (12pm for breakfast, 5pm for lunch, 10pm for dinner).
